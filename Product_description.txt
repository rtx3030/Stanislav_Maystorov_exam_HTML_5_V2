New Veganela real chocolate nut spread enriched with protein
Veganela is the first to offer a delicious, yet low sugar, real Belgium chocolate & nut spread on the Canadian market.
In Canada, the chocolate nut spreads are led by the famous brands like Nutella, that have lots of sugar. The healthier alternatives contain milk chocolate and again lots of sugar.
That is why Veganela was created! To meet the needs of protein enriched, vegan and vegetarian friendly, high quality spread. Real Belgium chocolate from sustainably sourced cocoa, no milk ingredients, no palm oil, no artificial flavors and tasty roasted nuts butters.
This offer also has 45% less sugar than the leading brand on the market and twice more highly digestible vegan protein. 
 This is consistent with our Veganela philosophy: Clean and clear label, healthy nutrition, sustainable energy for the body, indulgence without guilt.
We proudly produce this delicious spread, right here in Quebec and offer this luscious indulgence in 3 flavors: Dark chocolate & hazelnuts, Dark chocolate & roasted almonds   and Dark chocolate & Cashew.
This perfect snack has only 4 ingredients: dark chocolate, 25 % pure roasted nuts butter, almond protein, canola oil.
Enjoy guilt free!
